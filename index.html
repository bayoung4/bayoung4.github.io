<h3 style="font-family:comic sans MS;text-align:center; font-size:100%;">About Ben</h3>
<p>Ben describes himself as a lifelong amateur creator. Since his childhood building with Legos and playing Minecraft, and now with woodworking, Ben has always been creating. His experience as a woodworker began in the back of a hardware store in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Ben began working as a cashier at the Dorn True Value Sun prairie in 2020, and has since acquired skills as a small engines mechanic, window and window screen repairman, tool sharpener, and a woodworker. Doing small jobs for customers in Sun Prairie is what inspired Ben to want to create woodworking projects for others.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:comic sans MS;text-align:center; font-size:100%;">Woodworking Philosophy</h4>
<p>Why hand tools? Machines may be more efficient and get things built in a fraction of the time, but when it comes to quality, nothing is better than a well maintained tool in the right woodworker's hands. The main difference between machinine and using hand tools is with machines, the material is fed into the machine, while with hand tools, the woodworker feeds the tool into the material. This allows woodworkers to make finer adjustments while working with their tools that machines simply cannot do. </p>
